            A time history of the simulator deceleration performance will be
            produced along with a table summarizing the stopping time and
            distance and comparing it with flight test data. An initial
            conditions checklist is available to verify the initial setup for
            each case. An out-of-tolerance condition will be flagged in the
            table by an asterisk (* ) next to the simulator generated
